# A deep reinforcement learning approach for early classification of time series
This repository contains an implementation of the [paper](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01825472/document) of Martinez Coralie, Guillaume Perrin, E Ramasso, Mich√®le Rombaut. A deep reinforcement learning approach for early classification of time series. 26th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO2018), Sep 2018, Rome, Italy. hal-01825472

## Data
The data used in this project is the [GunPoints datasets](http://timeseriesclassification.com/description.php?Dataset=GunPoint)  which comes from the [UCR/UEA archive](http://timeseriesclassification.com/TSC.zip) 

## Code
The code is divided as follows:
* The [Train.py](Train.py) python file contains the necessary code to run the training step
* The [Agent.py](Agent.py) python file contains the necessary code about the Agent (used model, memory, ...)
* The [Env.py](Env.py) python file contains all code about the environement used for reinforcement learning(reward, state, step, ...)
* The [utils.py](utils.py) python file contains all necessary utils function (loss_function and zeros_padding function)
* The [Import.py](Import.py) python file contains all necessary package to load

To run the training of model you should issue this following command:
```
$ python Train.py 

```
